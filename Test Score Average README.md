Test Score Average Calculator

Overview

This program asks the user to enter three test scores, calculates the average, and prints feedback based on the result. The goal is to give a quick evaluation of performance using basic Python input, functions, and conditional logic.

How It Works

The script collects three numeric scores from the user, computes the average, and then uses a series of conditions to determine the message that should be displayed. Feedback ranges from excellent performance to recommendations for improvement.
