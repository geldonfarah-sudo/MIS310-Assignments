Sales Analysis and Number Range Program
Overview

This script contains two separate problems.
The first part analyzes sales data for a five-day work week and determines which day had the highest sales.
The second part allows the user to enter a series of numbers, ending with 0, and calculates the range between the smallest and largest values.

How It Works
Problem 1

Two lists store the days of the week and their matching sales amounts.

A loop checks each sale to find the maximum value and the corresponding day.

The program outputs the highest sale and the day it occurred.

Problem 2

The user enters numbers one at a time until entering 0.

All non-zero numbers are stored in a list.

The program finds the smallest and largest values and computes the range.

If the user enters no valid numbers, the range defaults to 0.
