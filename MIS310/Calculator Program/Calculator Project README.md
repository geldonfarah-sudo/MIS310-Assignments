Calculator Application (Tkinter)

Overview

This project is a basic calculator built using Python’s Tkinter library. It performs standard arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The interface is simple, responsive, and designed to mimic a standard handheld calculator.

How It Works

The program uses a Tkinter window with buttons for digits and operations. Each button updates an expression string, which is evaluated when the equals button is pressed. Error handling is included to prevent crashes from invalid input. The layout is structured using frames and grid positioning.
