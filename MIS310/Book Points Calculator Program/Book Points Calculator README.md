Book Points Calculator (Tkinter)
Overview

This program creates a small graphical interface that calculates reward points based on the number of books a user purchases. After entering a number, the program displays the correct amount of points earned according to a fixed points system.

How It Works

The user enters the number of books into a Tkinter entry box. When the “compute points” button is clicked, the program checks the value and assigns points using a series of conditions:

0 books → 0 points

2 books → 5 points

4 books → 15 points

6 books → 30 points

8 or more books → 60 points

The result is then shown in a label below the button.
